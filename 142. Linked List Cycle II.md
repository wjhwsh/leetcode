 Suppose F denode distance from start to circle start, a denode distance from circle start to point in circle where fast meet slow, C denote cicle lenght. Since fast
 is twice fast than slow, hence when they meet fast pass twice distance as slow pass, 2 * (F + a) = F + a + nC, (n > 0), -> F = (n - 1)C + a, so after meet , let fast
 start moving from head and slow start moving from point they first meet, the point they meet the secondtime will be the start of circle.
